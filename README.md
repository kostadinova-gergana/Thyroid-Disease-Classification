Advancements in Thyroid Disease Classification: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

This report presents an overview of previous research on thyroid disease classification and employs machine learning and deep learning models to classify healthy individuals and patients with hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Correlation analysis revealed associations between thyroid hormone levels and thyroid disease risk, highlighting the importance of feature selection techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to optimize model training. The study corroborates previous findings of high accuracy rates with machine learning algorithms, particularly support vector machine (SVM), outperforming deep learning models. Limitations include the small sample size, suggesting the need for validation on larger datasets. Future research should focus on enriching dataset size and exploring additional features to enhance model performance and generalizability. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of thyroid disease classification and underscores the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in this domain.
