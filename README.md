Advancements in Thyroid Disease Classification: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

This report presents an overview of previous research on thyroid disease classification and employs machine learning and deep learning models to classify healthy individuals and patients with hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Correlation analysis revealed associations between thyroid hormone levels and thyroid disease risk, highlighting the importance of feature selection techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to optimize model training. The study corroborates previous findings of high accuracy rates with machine learning algorithms, particularly support vector machine (SVM). Overall, this report contributes to the understanding of various features associated with thyroid disease and underscores the efficacy of machine learning algorithms on smaller datasets in comparison to deep learning models.
